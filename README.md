# Overview
TheSTRAT is a trading method developed by Rob Smith (@RobInTheBlack).  

Before beginning you have to have a basic understanding of candlesticks 
There are two major parts to TheSTRAT
### Candle / Pricing Action
  * 1 Candle
    * Names: 1 Candle / Inside Bar / Inside Action / Consolidation / Sideways
    * Technical: occur when the current candle falls completely within the prior candle
    * Meaning: balance, equilibrium, buyers and sellers agree on price, no one is in control, trying to determine where price is going next
    * Detail: never trade a one bar, wait for the consolidation to stop then it's time to get into a trade
  * 2 Candle
    * Names: 2 Candle / Directional Bar / 2 Down / 2 Up
    * Technical: occur when the current candle takes out one side of the prior candle
      * A 2 down means it took out the previous candle's low, but failed to take out the high
      * A 2 up means it took out the previous candle's high, but failed to take out the low
    * Meaning: sellers are selling it down or buyers are buying it up but not both, a 2 can turn into a 3, but never a 1 
    * Action: the market trades in the direction of the most 2's, but only trade 2's with continuation
  * 3 Candle
    * Names: 3 Candle / Outside Bar / Discovery Candle / Mother Bar
    * Technical: occur when the current candle takes out both sides of the prior candle
    * Meaning: price discovery starting over, buyers willing to buy it up, sellers willing to buy it down, choppiness
    * Action: never trade a mother bar, price discovery is happening, wait for further confirmation one way or anther
### Other Factors
* Time Frame Continuity
  * Price direction is best determined when looking at multiple time frames rather than lagging indicators or moving averages
  * When all time frames point in the same direction in either direction, or Full Time Frame Continuity, is the ideal trading situation
* Broadening Formations 
  * Increasing price volatility and diagrammed as two diverging trend lines, one rising and one falling
  * It usually occurs after a significant rise, or fall, in pricing action
  * It is identified on a chart by a series of higher pivot highs and lower pivot lows.
  * Directional bars and outside bars that fit into a triangle and ultimately lead to reversals or expansions and present trading opportunities
