# Overview
TheSTRAT is a trading method developed by Rob Smith (@RobInTheBlack).  

Before beginning you have to have a basic understanding of candlesticks 
There are two major parts to TheSTRAT
* Candle / Pricing Action
  * 1 Candle
    * Names: 1 Candle / Inside Bar / Inside Action / Consolidation / Sideways
    * Technical: occur when the current candle falls completely within the prior candle
    * Meaning: balance, equilibrium, buyers and sellers agree on price, no one is in control
    * Action: nothing, never trade a one bar, wait for the consolidation to stop then it's time to get into a trade
  * 2 Candle
    * Names: 2 Candle / Directional Bar / 2 Down / 2 Up
    * Technical: occur when the current candle takes out one side of the prior candle
      * A 2 down means it took out the previous candle's low, but failed to take out the high
      * A 2 up means it took out the previous candle's high, but failed to take out the low
    * Meaning: 
  * 3 Bar/Outside Bars - Outside Bars occur when the current candle takes out both sides of the prior candle.
There are also a few important principles to keep in mind:

Time Frame Continuity - Price direction is best assessed by looking at multiple timeframes rather than moving averages or other lagging indicators. The ideal situation occurs when all time frames point in the same direction, which is known as Full Time Frame Continuity.
Broadening Formations - The emergence of Directional Bars and Outside Bars create Broadening Formations that fit into a triangle and ultimately lead to reversals or expansions where trading opportunities may be present.
Inside Bars - Inside Bars are the key decision point when the market reaches equilibrium and must decide where prices are going in the immediate future.
